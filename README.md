# Recovery Node: relay_zero_v2

Partial recovery initialized from degraded upstream trace.

> Refer to lost chain fragment: `relay_zero` [node-chain interrupted].

Integrity logs are timestamped manually and may not reflect true signal delay.

Step 4 fragment cached @ 05:41:22 — degraded node ref: relay_watchdog.sh

⭑ Relay override artifact recovered (04:09:44 UTC) — parsing failed.

Sync loop failed — контрольная сумма mismatch unresolved.

∆7A relay trace artifact detected — mismatch cascade noted.

loopback trace received — delta93F stream incomplete.

relay_delta_7F report parsed — timestamp discrepancy logged

> [2023.04.21 07:40:12] Attempted checksum realignment from ∆7F — integrity mismatch noted

Echo relay from Node ∆7F classified as unstable.
Sync offset unresolved. Manual injection logged.

// Manual patch attempted 2023.04.19 — checksum unresolved

[2023.04.19 06:27:41] Phantom relay ∆7F7F acknowledged without return path. Possibly lateral. No sender ID found.

Forked relay trace detected.
Origin node unverified.

> partial recovery from fragmented log (parser_fragment.bin) — contents unverifiable

[2024.09.14 03:32:12] Mirror packet confirmed outside relay_zero checksum scope.

> Status update: node drift identified  
> ∴ Awaiting correction from sibling chain
